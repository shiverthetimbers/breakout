            <h3>Getting Started</h3>
            <p>I know, I know... The obligatory canvas game. "Tune in this week" - <span>Aspiring Developers S:1 E:(9.56e11)</span>. This is my prevailing thought during the project as well. But, I gotta start somewhere.</p>
            <p>First! To differentiate this project from others, I will not (present tense because I'm currently writing the code) be following any tutorials for this project. There are thousands of "code-with-me" follow along versions of this game out there.</p>
            <p>I started to watch a few and like I said earlier, the deja vu was nauseating. So, in an effor to stand out in a field of beaten dead horses, this project will be my own work with reference only to language documentation or stack overflow articles.</p>
            <h3>After Completion</h3>
            <p>I hadn't used canvas before attempting this project. Parts of that were challenging to figure out. The most challenging aspect was... <span> come back later and finish blog</span>!</p>

            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <p>The goal is to break all the blocks with the ball.</p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Move the paddle left and right with the arrows on your keyboard.</li>
                    <li>Position the paddle to hit the ball back towards the blocks.</li>
                    <li>If the ball gets past your paddle, game over.</li>
                </ul>
